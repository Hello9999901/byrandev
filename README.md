# byrandev (V1.0)
 nrf52840 dev board, highly experimental.
 The components based off the [mikoto](https://github.com/zhiayang/mikoto) board.
 I will do some finishing touches when I have the time.
 Since the board is two layered, it can be made affordably and be _directly integrated_ into larger boards with no issue.
 
### There are currently no instructions, I will write them sometime in the future :)

### PCB (28 GPIO pins)
